Description: This creates code names that a user can consider for their organizations, their projects, themselves, people
    in their organizations or projects, or whatever else. The user can also supply a numeric seed (and even a character seed)
    for maximum reproducibility. Use is simple and the code names produced come in various types too, contingent on what the
    user may be desiring as a code name or nickname.
